TEEC_Initialise context:

It initialises a new TEE context forming a connection between its client application and TEE identified by string identifier name

name: a zero determined string that determines the TEE to connect to,If this parameter is set to NULL,the implementation must set to default TEE
Context:a TEEC_Context structure that must be initaialised by implementation

TEEC_OpenSeesion:

Parameters

context: a pointer to an initialized TEE Context.
session: a pointer to a Session structure to open.
destination: a pointer to a structure containing the UUID of the destination Trusted Application.
connectionMethod: the method of connection to use. Refer to section 4.4.5 for more details.
connectionData: any necessary data required to support the connection method chosen.
operation: a pointer to an Operation containing a set of Memory References to exchange with
the Trusted Application, or NULL if no message buffers are to be exchanged or if the operation
cannot be cancelled. Refer to TEEC_InvokeCommand for more details.
returnOrigin: a pointer to a variable which will contain the return origin. This field may be NULL
if the return origin is not needed.
Return

TEEC_SUCCESS, then the Session was opened successfully
An error code otherwise:
o If returnOrigin is TEEC_ORIGIN_TRUSTED_APP, the meaning of the return value
depends on the protocol between the Client Application and the Trusted Application. In
any case, a value of 0 (TEEC_SUCCESS) means that the session was successfully opened
and a non-zero value means that the session opening failed.
o If the returnOrigin is other than TEEC_ORIGIN_TRUSTED_APP, the Implementation
MUST return one of the error codes from Table 4-2 to denote the reason why the session
opening or temporary memory registration was not successful. In particular, if the return
value is TEEC_ERROR_CANCEL then the operation was cancelled. Note the Trusted
